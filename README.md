On September 15, 2022, the current Ethereum Mainnet will merge with the Beacon Chain proof-of-stake (POS) system. The merge marks the end of proof-of-work (POW) for Ethereum, and the full transition to POS. After that, tons of hash rates on the current Ethereum network will redistributed to altcoins such as Raven, Ergo, Ethereum Classic, etc. However, none of those mineable altcoins has capability to absorb the computational power from Ethereum. That means, a large number of miners may choose to turn off their rigs because of the negative (or near-zero) profit and/or the complexity of coin selection.



Now Mining Mate comes to help. It helps all GPU and ASIC miners find the new balance between electricity cost and mining reward. With Mining Mate, miners are able to track realtime market, network and reward status of mineable coins. Meanwhile, after adding GPU and ASIC rigs to your hardware list, Mining Mate automatically provides optimal and the most profitable coin combinations. With Mining Mate, you donâ€™t need to struggle with the selection of coins and algorithms any more!


Key features:


1. Monitor realtime crypto market

2. Monitor more than 30 mineable coins, e.g., Ergo, Conflux, Raven Coin, Ethereum Classic, etc.

3. Customized hardware list, support major GPUs (AMD and NVidia) and ASIC miners.

4. Realtime mining profit, reward, and cost analysis based on user's hardware list.
